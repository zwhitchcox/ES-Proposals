I hereby propose we create an alias, `each` for `forEach`.

This falls in line with the nomenclature of iterative Array prototype functions in javascript, e.g., `every`, `some`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc., of having one word to describe the loop. It creates cleaner code, is more precise, and just looks better. It's also a pain to have to write `forEach` rather than `each`, and, frankly, the other languages are laughing at us about this.

So, let's write some cleaner code with with `each` instead of `forEach`!
